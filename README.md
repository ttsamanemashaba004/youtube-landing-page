Implement hover effects for category items to improve user interaction.
Use an 'active' attribute or state to visually highlight the active category.
Ensure the categories section is scrollable horizontally, mimicking the behavior on the YouTube home page.


Include a styled footer with all required categories and links, similar to the original design.
Add and style copyright text to match YouTubeâ€™s footer.
